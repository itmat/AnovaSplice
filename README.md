## ToDo
* Run data through without correction
* Run on Rofe versus cele
* Add track with significant exons (sign if < .25)

## Notes

### Annotation

Map exons to RefSeq and then to ensembl gene id's using the gene2ensmbl.gz obtained from the NCBI ftp server: <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/>.
RefSeq annotation itself was obtained as gtf file from UCSC table browser.
